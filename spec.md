# Professional Headshot AI App - Specification Document

## Overview

A professional headshot AI application that allows users to upload a photo, select from three predefined styles, and receive a professionally styled headshot using Google's Gemini nano banana image-to-image API. The app features a side-by-side comparison view to evaluate the transformation.
